## My process
- Download all files and get familiar with the designs
- Open Atom editor and save files
- Initalise git repository
- Draft README with information so far
- Experiment with CSS grid
- Add in images
- Look through design files for relative sizing
- Change all sizes to rem dimensions
- Research and read about arranging background images
- Adjust background circles using background image properties and referring to designs
- Amend border styles
- Check against designs again
- Adjust text classes and styling of fonts
- Make notes for feedback questions


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Atom editor
- An eight year old laptop with an AMD processor!


### What I learned

- Using negative margins in CSS
- Altering the attributes of background images in CSS
- Effect of using rem dimensions with fonts


### Continued development

- Image borders: there is an inner blue border and I don't know why it is there
- How vertical centering works in CSS grid. I tried out, but still needed to add in a top margin
- Better ways of positioning background images

### Useful resources

- [Colour converter](https://convertacolor.com/) - This helped me when atom insisted on fallback colours for the HSL values
- [Positioning background images](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-position.asp) - Really useful when I was working out how to position the larger blue circles
- [Guide to using negative margins](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/07/the-definitive-guide-to-using-negative-margins/) - This blog post made me feel it was OK to use negative margins in CSS
